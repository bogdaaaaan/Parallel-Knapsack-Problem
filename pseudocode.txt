        do things


create matrix, chunks (list of indexes each thread will compute), and empty list of threads
create threads, give each info about items and it's chunk, fill threads list

for each row (beside first):
    fill each thread with new data about work (matrix state, current row index)

    for each thread in thread list:
        thread.compute_work()

    for each thread in thread list:
        thread.get_data()

    collect work and fill current row with results from each thread
